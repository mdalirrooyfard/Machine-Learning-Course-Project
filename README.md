# Machine Learning Course Project

This is a project to predict Click Through rate. (CTR)

Classic models implemented:
  - Random Forest
  - SVM
  - Logistic Regression
  - XGBoost

Professional models implemented:
  - Factorization Machine
  - Field Weighted Factorization Machine

Resource papers for the professional models:
  - Field-weighted Factorization Machines for Click-Through Rate Prediction in Display Advertising, J. Pan, J. Xu, .et al, Proceedings of the 2018 World Wide Web Conference, 2018.
  - Factorization Machines, S. Rendle, IEEE International Conference on Data Mining, 2010.

The following metrics have been used to compare the results:
  - AUC
  - F1 measure
  - Cross Entropy Loss
  - Accuracy
  - real CTR based on predicted CTR
